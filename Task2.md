Convolutional layers are the core building blocks of CNNs, designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Here's a breakdown of how they function:

  Filters (Kernels):
        A filter is a small matrix (typically of size 3x3, 5x5, etc.) that is applied across the input image to detect specific features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
        The filter slides (convolves) over the input image, performing element-wise multiplication and summing the results to produce a single value. This process is repeated across the entire image, producing a feature map (also known as an activation map).

  Strides:
        Stride refers to the number of pixels by which the filter moves over the input image. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, while a stride of 2 means it moves two pixels at a time.
        Larger strides result in smaller output dimensions, as the filter covers the image more coarsely.

  Padding:
        Padding involves adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the border of the input image. This allows filters to fully cover the edges of the image.
        There are two main types of padding:
            Valid Padding: No padding is applied, and the filter only scans the valid part of the image, resulting in a smaller output.
            Same Padding: Padding is applied such that the output feature map has the same

Dimensions as the input. This is achieved by adding an appropriate number of zeros around the input image.
Example with a Sample Image

Let's perform these steps using an example image. Since I cannot directly capture an image, I'll describe the process assuming we have an image called image.jpg with a timestamp and location metadata.

  Capture and Preprocess the Image:
        Assume we have captured an image image.jpg and preprocessed it by resizing and normalizing as described previously.

  Applying a Convolutional Layer:
        For demonstration, let's use a simple 3x3 filter to detect edges in the image.



      import cv2
      image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
      resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
      normalized_image = resized_image / 255.0
      
      import numpy as np
      sobel_filter = np.array([[-1, 0, 1],
                               [-2, 0, 2],
                               [-1, 0, 1]])
      
      
      def apply_filter(image, filter):
          image_height, image_width = image.shape
          filter_height, filter_width = filter.shape
          pad_height = filter_height // 2
          pad_width = filter_width // 2
          padded_image = np.pad(image, ((pad_height, pad_height), (pad_width, pad_width)), mode='constant', constant_values=0)
          output = np.zeros((image_height, image_width))
          for i in range(image_height):
              for j in range(image_width):
                  output[i, j] = np.sum(filter * padded_image[i:i+filter_height, j:j+filter_width])
          return output
      
      grayscale_image = cv2.cvtColor(normalized_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
      feature_map = apply_filter(grayscale_image, sobel_filter)
      
      
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
          plt.imshow(feature_map, cmap='gray')
          plt.title('Feature Map after Convolution')
          plt.show()

Explanation of Convolution Process

    Filters:
        The 3x3 Sobel filter is used to detect edges in the image. It slides over the image and computes the dot product between the filter and the image patch it overlaps with, generating a new feature map highlighting the edges.

    Strides:
        Using a stride of 1 ensures that the filter moves one pixel at a time, allowing for a detailed and high-resolution feature map.

    Padding:
        Using 'same' padding ensures the output feature map has the same dimensions as the input image. This is achieved by padding the input image with zeros around the borders.

By following these steps, we have demonstrated how a convolutional layer in a CNN processes an image using filters, strides, and padding to extract meaningful features. These feature maps are then used in subsequent layers of the CNN to perform tasks such as image classification, object detection, and more.
